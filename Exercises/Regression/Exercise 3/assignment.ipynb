    "You are a data scientist / AI engineer at an educational consulting firm. You have been provided with a dataset named **`\"student_scores.csv\"`**, which includes records of the number of hours students studied and the marks they obtained. The dataset comprises the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hours:` The number of hours a student studied.\n",
    "- `scores:` The marks obtained by the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to use this dataset to build a polynomial regression model to predict the marks of students based on the number of hours they studied. You will need to split the data into training and test sets, train the model, and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics."
